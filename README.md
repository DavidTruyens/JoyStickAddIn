# JoyStickAddIn
Control your assembly with an XBox controller

This is a registry free addin for Autodesk Inventor 2015. 
It enables a XBox controler to change key parameters in an Inventor assembly. This way it's possible to take control of your machine!

Currently it only works with one joystick (on an xbox controler the upper left one). I hope to make a full XBox controler available.

If you would like to test it download this dll and the addin file here and paste it into: C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins
